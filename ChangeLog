	* snmpmon.PL (Start): Fixed use of setlogsock for Solaris.
	  (This is becoming a nightmare ...)
	* README: Fixed references to gnuplot sources.
	* lib/SNMP/Monitor/Event/IfLoad.pm (Process): Fixed INSERT statement,
	  so that NULL values are never used.

	My thanks to Lupe Christoph, <lupe@alanya.m.isar.de>

	* Added support for Solaris.

	* lib/SNMP/Monitor/Install.pm: The AddRouter() method is now
	  sending separate requests for each interface it detects and
	  not one reuqest for all interfaces. (It seems that some
	  hubs can't work with fragmented packets.)
